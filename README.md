# AirForce
An efficient and powerful tool built for Shortcuts for tracking and finding flights all over the world in seconds.

## The project
AirForce is a Siri Shortcuts for iOS and iPadOS. This repository contains the code for the serverless API that the shortcut uses for retrieving data more efficiently.

## Installation
AirForce is compatible with iOS and iPadOS 14. Get it for free at [https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5015](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5015)

## Project Status
The latest version of AirForce is obsolete and not compatible with iOS14 or newer. This repo contains the newer and under development version of AirForce that will be published once both API and Shortcut will be stable enough.
